# Yahtzee
This will be a Yahtzee-App. It will have the option of a npc-opponent, and feature the play-modes: Free (Where you can place your round result in any of your fields that aren't filled) and Forced (Where you go down the line, one row at the time). The game will also have local-multiplayer and a dice roller incorperated, and simple way of telling the console, what dice to re-roll and if you wanna end your round earlier than normal
